    <p>If you aren't mixing sour cream into your cookie batter, you could be missing out on a fantastic cookie
        experience. Sour cream boasts high fat levels and a fair amount of acidity. Both factors give baked goods a
        hefty dose of moisture, as well as a bright, tangy flavor.</p>
    <p>Additionally, sour cream does do not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might, which
        lends the baked cookies a tender, fluffy texture. So whether you just need to use up some extra sour cream or
        want to enjoy some cookies with a delightfully delicate crumb, check out these sour cream cookie recipes, and
        whip up a batch of your own.</p>
