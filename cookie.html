    <p>If you aren't mixing sour cream into your cookie batter, you could be missing out on a fantastic cookie
        experience. Sour cream boasts high fat levels and a fair amount of acidity. Both factors give baked goods a
        hefty dose of moisture, as well as a bright, tangy flavor.</p>
    <p>Additionally, sour cream does do not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might, which
        lends the baked cookies a tender, fluffy texture. So whether you just need to use up some extra sour cream or
        want to enjoy some cookies with a delightfully delicate crumb, check out these sour cream cookie recipes, and
        whip up a batch of your own.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>½ pint sour cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whiskey</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup confectioners' sugar for decoration</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat together the egg yolks, sour cream, white sugar, vanilla and whiskey until smooth.
            Stir in flour until dough is stiff enough to knead. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth.
            Knead in additional flour if necessary. Divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces and roll each ball on floured
            surface. Cut into strips about 3 inches long then make a slit long ways down the middle. Pull one of the
            ends through like a bow.</li>
        <li>Place into hot oil and deep fry until golden brown. Let drain on paper towels and sprinkle with
            confectioners' sugar.</li>
    </ol>
